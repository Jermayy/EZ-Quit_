## Description:
MERN stack mobile-first web application to help user's track their cigarette smoking frequency and help them on their journey to quitting for good. Users can log in and set their daily limit of cigarettes they will be able to smoke. The user's dashboard has a button that the user can press when they have a cigarette which provides visual feedback and updates the remaining cigarettes they have left for that day. Users can also save notes that they can refer back too later on to keep track of their progress.

## Installation:
Within the Terminal type "npm i" or "npm install" to install dependencies to run application on your local machine using Node.

## Usage:
to run the application locally type "npm run start" into your Terminal. Alternatively a live deployed version of the application can be accessed here:  https://enigmatic-depths-23820.herokuapp.com/
